# Backfilling a CUR file for the MAP program #

If you're participating in AWS's Migration Assistance Program, you want to get the maximum credit from the MAP program.

One thing to consider is a longer trail of data within your Cost and Usage Report (CUR).  In order to get the most out of nOps, we recommend filling out a support ticket with AWS to do a CUR backfill.  This will load your CUR file with previous months' data, allowing you to get better insight.

## Creating the Ticket for MAP CUR backfill ##

For each Payer account, log into your [Amazon Support Console](https://support.console.aws.amazon.com/support) to create a support ticket.  Please CC your point of contact at nOps in your support ticket, or inform them when the backfill has been completed.
